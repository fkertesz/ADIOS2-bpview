BPView: Browser for ADIOS2 BP files.

Overview:

Extreme-scale computing is used to improve handling of large and complex datasets. To capture benefits of extreme-scale computing for data management, we created BPView, a powerful Python-based graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI enhances display and visualization of data stored in binary-pack (BP) files; BP files  are generated by Adaptable Input/Output System version 2 (ADIOS2) . The GUI combines the functionalities of the “bpls” command and the “gsplot.py” and “pdfplot.py” programs and its layout is inspired by HDFView and eSimMon. The “bpls” command transforms a BP file into human-readable format and is used to display the data; the “gsplot.py” program creates 2-dimensional data plots and the “pdfplot.py” program creates 1-dimensional plots, thereby visualizing the data but they are specific to one set of example data. The GUI has multiple options for viewing the data: displaying in any dimensions, plotting one or multiple steps in one and two dimensions, and plotting two one-dimensional arrays against each other. The BPView program taps various user libraries in Python, including ADIOS2, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Tkinter. The program uses the ADIOS2 library to read the data and implements NumPy to store and manipulate data in multidimensional arrays which serve as inputs that Matplotlib uses to visualize the data. The Tkinter library is the basis of the GUI, thus making it user-friendly. Using this combination of different libraries and multiple viewing functions in a single application creates a powerful means for viewing BP files. Because the program provides an interface combining the display and visualization of the ADIOS2-native binary-pack files, the GUI is more efficient at viewing ADIOS2 outputted datasets than previous terminal-based test-only tools. Ultimately, BPView is currently the most powerful interface for displaying and plotting data from BP files, contributing to further advancements in science and ADIOS2 development.
